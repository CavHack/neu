# neu
"neu" is a Context-Free HSL protocol stack abiding to SWIFFT paradigms. Enabling a Cryptograhic stream to be pruned and partitioned; distributed across self-assembling containers - rendering an iterative instruction set, with the aim to (1)mask root access and (2)inject a remotely 'compartmentalized fuzzy-ing' of containers. (3) Embedding and exposing GPGPU capabilities remotely.
